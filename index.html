My name is Georges Oppenheim.

I’m a mathematician and applied researcher with deep expertise in modeling, optimization, and data analysis, blending classical methods with modern AI. 
<br>
With decades of experience spanning academia and industry, I’ve designed and implemented data-driven solutions across diverse domains including aerospace, energy, automotive, finance, and environmental science.
<br>
My work leverages a rich methodological toolkit—ranging from signal processing and wavelets to deep learning and reinforcement learning. 
<br>
I’ve authored over a hundred scientific publications, developed software used globally, and led research collaborations with organizations like EDF, Renault, and Total. 
<br>
I currently serve as CEO of a fintech startup and am an emeritus professor of mathematics.
